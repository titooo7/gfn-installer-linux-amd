# GeForce NOW Unofficial Installer for AMD PC's running Linux üöÄ

A simple, one-step installer script to get NVIDIA GeForce NOW running perfectly on Arch-based Linux distributions with AMD hardware.

This script automates the entire process of installing GeForce NOW and applies the necessary workarounds to make it run flawlessly, just as it would on a Steam Deck.

-----

## Why Should I Use This Installer? ü§î

As of August 2025, NVIDIA officially supports GeForce NOW on Linux **only for the Steam Deck**, which can prevent it from running correctly on other desktop Linux systems.

This installer gets around that limitation. It installs the official GeForce NOW application via Flatpak and then creates a special launch script with the necessary tweaks and parameters needed to overcome the standard restrictions. **We aren't installing anything that the official application wouldn't install**; the only addition is this lightweight launcher that makes it all work seamlessly on your system.

You should also use installer if you have GeForce NOW Ultimate subscription and you want to play upto 4K 60FPS on your AMD Linux computer (depending on your hardware you might not be able to do more than 1440p or 1080p)

## Features ‚ú®

  * **Fully Automated:** Runs a single script to handle everything from installation to configuration.
  * **Custom Launcher:** Creates a special launcher with the required tweaks to run GeForce NOW on unsupported systems.
  * **Error Fixes:** Automatically applies configurations to prevent common connection and launch issues.
  * **Universal Shortcut Creation:** Modifies both the **Application Menu** entry and the **Desktop** shortcut to use the custom launcher.
  * **Adaptive Configuration:** Intelligently detects your desktop environment (GNOME/Cinnamon vs. KDE/Other) to make shortcuts launchable correctly.

-----

## Requirements üìã

  * An **Arch-based Linux distribution** (e.g., CachyOS).
      * *Note: It may work on other Linux distributions that support Flatpak, but I only tested it on CachyOS (Arch-based system).*
  * An **AMD CPU and integrated AMD GPU**.
  * **Flatpak** installed and configured on your system. If you don't have it, you can install it with:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S flatpak
    ```

### Tested Hardware ‚úîÔ∏è

This script was successfully tested on a **Chuwi AuBox Mini-PC** with the following specifications:

  * **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS
  * **GPU:** AMD Radeon 780M

I'm now able to play at 4K 60FPS when my MiniPC is connected to my 4K TV.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

Open your terminal and follow these three simple steps:

**1. Download the Installer Script:**

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titooo7/gfn-installer-linux-amd/main/install-gfn.sh
```

**2. Make the Script Executable:**

```bash
chmod +x install-gfn.sh
```

**3. Run the Script:**

```bash
./install-gfn.sh
```

The script will handle the rest. Once it finishes, you can launch GeForce NOW from either your application menu or the icon on your desktop\!

-----

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The script performs the following actions:

1.  **Installs GeForce NOW:** It uses Flatpak to install the official GeForce NOW application along with its required runtimes.
2.  **Applies Overrides:** It configures the Flatpak sandbox with necessary permissions.
3.  **Creates a Custom Launcher:** A new bash script (`geforce-now-launcher.sh`) is created in `$HOME/.local/bin/`. This launcher applies specific configurations and parameters before starting the app.
4.  **Modifies Shortcuts:** The script finds the `.desktop` files for both the application menu and the desktop icon and changes their `Exec` command to point to our new custom launcher.
5.  **Makes Shortcuts Launchable:** It detects your desktop environment and uses the appropriate command (`gio set` for GNOME/Cinnamon or `chmod +x` for KDE/XFCE) to ensure the icons are immediately clickable.

I was able to pull this together thanks to the information shared by several users in this thread https://gist.github.com/Mihitoko/bd76340e56e78ec972c8a1365abb0d55#file-install-geforcenow-on-desktop-linux-md
If if wasn't thanks to several users there I wouldn't have been able to create this installer.
